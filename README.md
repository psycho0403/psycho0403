## 👋 About Me, Gustaf Ekstrand
Hi, I'm a student studying Game Development. I am passionate when it comes to games and programming.
I have previously completed curses in both C# and C++ furthermore I'd say that I'm deeply experienced in using Unity,
having created a handful of school projects with it,
as well as being experienced with scripting and optimizing gameplay systems and other applications for those projects.
